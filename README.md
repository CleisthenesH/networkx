# Intro
This repository is a quick-proof of concept for using the python and the networkx library to import publicly available traffic data to find and report on the presence of cliques.

# Example 1
In this example I use networkx's inbuilt example weighted graph to find and highlight cliques of size 4.
The source code is located in the file "example1.py":
